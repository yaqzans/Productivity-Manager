# Productivity-Manager
This "project" was done for OOP2 course. It is done in C# and has database connections. MS SQL was used, with tables created in local server. The images added showcases the columns in each table. 
Multiple users can either signup or login without their data conflicting as their id is used as foreign key in other tables.
This is basically a combination of a reminder app, a notes app and a timer app. There are some sorting features in the tasks section and a seach feature in the notes section.
